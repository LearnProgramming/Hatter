LPMC in general, and Hatter in particular, is always looking for new contributors.

1. Fork Hatter
2. Create a topic branch - `git checkout -b my_branch`
3. Make your changes
4. Push to your branch - `git push origin my_branch`
5. Send a pull-request for your topic branch

As this is a learning project you'll receive a thorough code review prior to any features being merged.

Stop by our IRC channel, #LPMC on freenode, if you have any questions, or just want to hang out.
